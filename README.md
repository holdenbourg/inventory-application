# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
I was tasked with creating an inventory application that allowed users to log in (or create an account if they don't already have one). Once signed in, they would land on the specified warehouse's inventory page. Here, they will see a grid/list of all the objects (item name and quantity) in said warehouse. On top of this, the user can increase and decrease the quantity of a given item, add items and their respective quantities to the list, and/or remove items from the list. Lastly, there is a notifications feature for the user. Once logged in (for the first time), a notification will pop up asking for the ability to send notifications to the device. If approved, the application will send a notification every time a given item's quantity reaches zero.

# What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
This project required a login screen, register screen, login/register functionality (saving account inforamtion for later verification on login), inventory screen with a gridview composed of custom grid items that allowed for item name and quantity with the ability to increment and decrement the quantity or remove the item all together, an add item screen that would add the given item and name into teh database for later use on the stated inventory screen, and a notifdications sstem that would notify the device when an irtem's quantoty has reached zero. This UI kept users in mind by making it as easy to navigate as possible, all the while not compromising functionality or the project's original structure. I would say these designs were highly successful and accomplished what I set out to do from the start.

# How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?


# How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?


# Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?


# In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
